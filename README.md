# NQueens with USC, A* and Genetic Algorithm

- Lab homework from HCMUS's 2023 Introduction to AI course.

## Content

- Read the attached pdf for full details.

### UCS and A*

- Initially, all the queens are placed at row -1, each column is occupied by exactly one queen.
- The solution for a specific N will always be the same no matter how many times it's run.

```

### Genetic Algorithm

- Each generation has 100 chromosomes, there is an option to print out all generations with their chromosomes.
- The fittest chromosome is one where the number of attacking pairs of queens is 0. Mutation probability is set to 0.8.
- **The algorithm takes ***very long*** to find a solution.**
